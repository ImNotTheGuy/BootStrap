# Introduction to bootstrap

Helps the developer avoid spending too much time on design and writing CSS. It keeps a coherent design system accross the web/mobile - app 


## Project organization

All CSS files will go in `css` folder:

New folder [vendor](/css/vendor/) where we put the CSS written by third parties

New folder [page](/css/page/) where we put the CSS specific to certain HTML pages.

New file [style.css](/css/style.css) where we'll put the CSS code shared throughout the webpages of our projects.

## Import bootstrap in the HTML

To use the bootstrap CSS file, simply add a link to the head of the HTML:
 ```<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/vendor/bootstrap.min.css">```
